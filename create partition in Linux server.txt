create partition in Linux server by shrinking existing disk.-:

1. lsblk    ----to check all disks and partition
2. sudo fdisk -l   ---to check all disks with their partition
3. indentify disk which you want to create partion-:
4. start fdisk with disk name---   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
5. resizing existing partion-:
  sudo parted /dev/sda     ---select disk
  In the parted prompt, follow these steps:
Display the partition table with print.
Select the partition to resize (/dev/sda1 in this case) using resizepart.
Choose the new end size (e.g., 25GB).
Example command to resize the partition:
-- command ---- "resizepart 1 25GB"
6. Create a new partition: After resizing, you can now use fdisk to create partion
   start fdisk with disk name---   sudo fdisk /dev/sda
   Create a New Partition:
After running the command, you will enter the fdisk interactive shell. Follow these steps:
Type n to create a new partition.
Type p to select a primary partition or e for an extended partition (depending on your needs).
Select the partition number (if prompted), or press Enter to choose the default.
Define the partition size by specifying the start and end sectors or the size (e.g., +20G for a 20 GB partition).
After creating the partition:
Type w to write the changes to the disk.
This will save the partition table and exit fdisk

7.
Format the New Partition:
Format the partition with a file system of your choice. For example, to format the partition with the ext4 filesystem:
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda17
Replace /dev/sda17 with your actual partition name.
8.
Mount the Partition:
To use the partition, you need to mount it. Create a mount point (a directory) and mount the partition:
sudo mkdir /mnt/new_partition
sudo mount /dev/sda17 /mnt/new_partition
9.
Make the Mount Permanent (Optional):
If you want the partition to mount automatically after reboot, edit the /etc/fstab file:
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add a line at the bottom like this:

/dev/sda17  /mnt/new_partition  ext4  defaults  0  2

Save and exit (Ctrl+O to write out, then Ctrl+X to exit).
