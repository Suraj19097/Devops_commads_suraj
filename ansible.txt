Whitelist port 5985(winrm-http) and 5986(winrm-https) in the security group of the the windows server.
Step3: Create HTTPS Listener
winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS '@{Hostname="DNS Name"; CertificateThumbprint="ThumbPrint"}'
Step4:
Add  new firewall rule for 5986
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5986
Step5:
